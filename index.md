* [**Summer Residential Camps: "Seeing through a Digital World"**](https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/theengineeringplace/summerprograms/hs-residential/) 
  * North Carolina State University, Summer 2024.
  * Theme: Networks are like the superhighways of the digital world, allowing our computers, smartphones, and other devices to talk to each other. Understanding how these networks look and work is crucial in todayâ€™s tech-driven society. That is where digital twin network comes in. It is a powerful tool that lets us explore the inner workings of computer networks within a virtual and controlled environment. This means we can experiment and learn them in a digital world, making it a cost-effective and safe way to design, optimize, and comprehend complex network systems.
  * Materials: hands-on scripts and examples with ready-to-use tools: [Colab](https://github.com/SummerEkko/NS-3_Examples/tree/master/Done)  [ns-3](https://github.com/SummerEkko/NS-3_Examples/tree/master)  [Visualizer (to be annonced)](xxx)

* **CSC/ECE-791 Advanced NextG Network Design** 
  * North Carolina State University, Spring 2024.
  * Theme: This course focuses on advanced technology, modeling, simulation and analysis of networks. The course first presents the key aspects and concepts of the networks which are already consolidated. These technical aspects are the background and then used to motivated many mechanisms in the new generation networks, such as 5G/6G, mmWave, Wi-Fi 7, and digital twins. The course will also be hands on with concepts demonstrated through use/modification of the simulation tool (ns-3), e.g., to demonstrate and investigate network behavior of a number of different network topologies and under a variety of conditions.

* **CSC/ECE-570 Computer Networks** 
  * North Carolina State University, Fall 2023.
  * Theme: General introduction to computer networks and Internet. Discussion of protocol principles, local area and wide area networking, OSI stack, TCP/IP and quality of service principles, network simulations. Detailed discussion, including quantitative analysis, modeling and algorithms of topics in physical layer, medium access control, error control coding, routing, and flow/congestion control mechanisms. Introduction to network architecture, wireless networking, and machine learning for networks.

* **ECE-3710 Circuit and Electronics**  
  * Georgia Institute of Technology, 2018-2019.
  * Theme: This course offers an introduction to electric circuit elements and electronic devices, alongside an exploration of circuits integrating these components. Through a series of learning objectives, students will determine voltages and currents within resistive networks, sketch the transient response of RC and RL circuits, and comprehend the standard transient responses of RLC circuits. They will utilize complex phasors to ascertain the steady-state responses of sinusoidal source voltages or currents, understand and analyze the frequency response characteristics of filters, and analyze power characteristics within reactive circuits. Additionally, students will construct and experiment with real circuits containing RLC components, op amps, diodes, and transistors, and design and assemble simple filters, rectifiers, and amplifiers.
