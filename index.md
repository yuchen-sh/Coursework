* **CSC/ECE-791 Advanced NextG Network Design** 
  * North Carolina State University, Spring 2024.
  * Theme: This course focuses on advanced technology, modeling, simulation and analysis of networks. The course first presents the key aspects and concepts of the networks which are already consolidated. These technical aspects are the background and then used to motivated many mechanisms in the new generation networks. The course will also be hands on with concepts demonstrated through use/modification of the simulation tool (ns-3), e.g., to demonstrate and investigate network behavior of a number of different network topologies and under a variety of conditions.
